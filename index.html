<p >
  Most of scientific instruments such as sundials, quadrants, astrolabes
are made of stainless steel, brass or other durable materials.

    Interestingly, scientific instruments made from paper or on paper
appeared about 500 years ago, soon after the invention of printing.

  Paper instruments are much cheaper and can be copied easiler than their
sturdy counterparts. Consequently, paper instruments serve as excellent
educational and demonstration tools. Despite their appearance, paper
instruments are quite capable and accurate.
